A mini guide to New York CityRisa LDestination ExpertBorn in Brooklyn, grew up outside ManhattanWhat’s one thing visitors shouldn't miss?People watching. Too many visitors have long lists of must-see spots. Instead, slow down and feel the heartbeat of the city.Read moreWhat do you wish tourists knew about New York City?Central Park is not a series of different sites to see—it's a nature reserve. Don’t worry about your Instagram pics—just get lost in it!Read moreLet us in on your favorite restaurants—what makes them great?Felice is a small chain of family-owned Tuscan restaurants in several convenient locations. It’s pretty affordable, and has great pasta and wines from the owner's vineyards. The Clam is my favorite seafood restaurant, and there's a nice wine bar right next door, Lela Bar. Balthazar bakery has great croissants, and dining solo at the bar means you'll never eat alone.Read moreAre there any activities that are better done on weekends vs. weekdays?Bring a book, a latte, and a good bakery muffin to any of the parks. Make yourself comfortable and watch the people go by. Weekday, weekend, any time of day. Your book will just be a prop—the street life is free entertainment.Read moreWhich top tourist attraction is worth the hype?It's New York City! The \"hype\" doesn't begin to cover it!Read moreWhy is New York City special to you?I have lived in Manhattan for far too long—nothing else compares! My rooftop is my yoga studio and my beach. World-class restaurants are my neighborhood bars. While I love to travel, when I catch sight of the NYC skyline through the plane window, my heart beats faster and I'm thrilled to be home.Read moreAboutRisa was born in Brooklyn and grew up outside of Manhattan.

No problems going up to the lower viewing platform. There's a cafe to buy food and drink if you want. No problems going up to the top viewing platform. It was fairly busy, but you could get to the edge and take in the view, with a bit of patience. Top of the Rock gives great views of the empire state, central Park and the south of Manhattan island. Highly recommended.

Broadway or Broadway Theatre is a theatre genre that consists of the theatrical performances presented in 41 professional theaters, each withs 500 or more seats, in the Theatre District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan. It's what New York City is all about. Broadway and London's West End represent the highest commercial level of theatrical entertainment in the English-speaking world. But here's an interesting trivia note: While the Broadway thoroughfare is closely identified with Times Square, only three theaters are located on Broadway--Broadway Theater, Palace Theater and Winter Garden Theater. The rest are located on the marked cross streets, extending from the Nederlander Theater one block south of Times Square on 41st Street, north along either side of Broadway to 53rd Street, and the Vivian Bennet Theater at Lincoln Center on West 65th Street. The Theatre District is a major tourist attraction, drawing 15 million people and paying over $1.8 billion in one season. My wife and I contributed our share by managing to secure tickets to see the newest version of the 1966 Tony Award winning musical Cabaret at the August Wilson Theater on West 52nd Street. As an added attraction, take time to visit the Museum of Broadway on West 45th Street. Open to the public in 2022, learn the history and experiences of Broadway theatre and its profound influence on shaping Midtown Manhattan and Times Square.Read moreReview of: BroadwayWritten July 16, 2024This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Like the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Located at 200 Central Park West, at 79th Street, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, in Theodore Roosevelt Park, across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 21 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls in addition to a library and a planetarium. Established in 1869, the museum contains 32 million specimens of plants, animals, fungi, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains and human cultural artifacts. The numbers are awesome. The museum occupies more than 2.5 million square feet of exhibition space, has a full-time scientific staff of 225 and sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year. Open from 10 to 5:30 daily, visitors can see everything from centuries-old specimens to entirely new types of specialized collections like frozen tissues and genomic data. The museum's scientific collection features more than 32 million specimens and artifacts from an irreplaceable record of life on Earth, the span of geologic time and knowledge about one vast universe.

      "An hour car ride from the city, or one hour and 15 minutes by train on the Hudson Line, is the trailhead for Anthony’s Nose. It may be only 1.3 miles to the top, but make sure you bring plenty of water because the climb is steep (and includes a 500-foot rock staircase). At the top, head to the overlook for views of Bear Mountain Bridge and the rolling hills surrounding the Hudson. If you’re feeling up for it, you can continue on the trail for another 3–4 miles before looping back to the start.\n",

      "Just two hours north of the city by car, this trail passes through open fields (with wildflowers, if you time it right) and woods before reaching the Bonticou Crag — the highlight of this 2.3-mile excursion. From the striking-white crag it’s nothing but greenish-blue views of the rolling hills below.\n",

      "If you’re craving a weekend in the woods (with mountain lake swimming to boot), this long but stunning trail might be just what you’re looking for. The Suffern-Bear Mountain Trail is a 23.2-mile point-to-point trail that takes hikers from Suffern, New York (one hour by car; one hour 15 minutes by train) to the northern entrance of Bear Mountain State Park. This challenging trip is best done over the course of two to three full days, and if you get lucky, you might have the trail (almost) to yourself.\n",

      "In Harriman State Park, a short 46 miles from the city, is the 10-mile Pine Meadow Trail. Ambitious hikers (or early risers) can do the full hike in a day, while others might want to make this a backpacking trip or turn around after a few miles. Either way, make sure you put aside time to sit on the shore of Pine Meadow Lake (around 2.5 miles in) and take in the view.\n",

The full route is 26.5-miles long, but for a short day walk, try hiking the 10-mile out-and-back trail from the town of Ossining to the New Croton Dam. This trail is more like a stroll than a hike, and the end goal — the picturesque dam — is well worth the trip.\n",

Here, on the other side of the Hudson River, you’ll find Fort Lee Historic Park atop a 33-acre cliff. The park is home to a reconstructed Revolutionary War encampment and miles and miles of trails. To start, we suggest taking the 5.5-mile Carpenter’s Loop trail, which takes hikers along the Englewood Cliffs and down near the shore of the Hudson.\n",

Here, you’ll find the Stairway to Heaven Trail, a 2.9-mile out-and-back route with a waterfall, wildflowers (if you time it right), and views for days. If you’re into bouldering, the way up has plenty of large boulders just waiting to be conquered.\n",
